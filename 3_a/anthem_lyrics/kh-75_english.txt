The Khmer Nation is famous in the world for their skill
and their victory and success in building great temples to morality
of the Noble and elevated Dhamma, the best of all national religions
The honor of our ancestors remains on the face of the earth.

CHORUS:
Khmer, rise and awake
Khmer, rise and awake
Khmer, rise and awake
Struggle to build the glorious state

The enemy sneak into Cambodia to make horrifying attacks
Win the final victory of the Khmer Nation
in order to remain a great country

Chorus
