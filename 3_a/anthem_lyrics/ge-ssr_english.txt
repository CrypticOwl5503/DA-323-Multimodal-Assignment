1. Praised be over the ages, my Homeland,
The renewed hearth of heroes,
By the great party’s mind
And Lenin’s wisdom you’ve been risen.

CHORUS:
Your dreams came true,
For which you shed your blood,
A tireless hand of toiler
Has brought you to bloom.

2. Shining of the Great October’s banners
Has illumed your hoary peaks,
Freedom, courage and doughtiness
Have turned you into the sunny land.

CHORUS:
In fraternal family of peoples
You’ve reached singular heights,
With friendship and nation-wide strength
You triumphed and triumph.

3. From time immemorial your
Mind, sword and courage were radiant.
Today Georgia’s serene future
Is forged by the generation of Lenin’s temper.

CHORUS:
The sun of communism is shining
Over you increasingly bright,
Praised be over the ages, my Motherland,
My native land!
