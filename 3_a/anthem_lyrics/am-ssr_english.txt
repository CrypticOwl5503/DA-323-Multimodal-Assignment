1. Soviet land, free land – Armenia!
You experienced the severe fate in the past,
Your sons struggled for you,
Nowadays you’ve become the Armenians’ own home.

CHORUS:
Glorious be, glorious be, our Soviet Armenia!
You’re both an architect and a builder, Armenia!
Being illumined by the fraternal peoples friendship,
You are going to the future, our Armenia!

2. The October’s life-giving breathing
Have rescued us, the Armenians, from an inevitable ruin.
New times came to us with Lenin.
The light-giving dawn shines.

Chorus

3. Russia extended to us a hand of friendship
The people have created the strong state.
Our Party, reliable and strong,
Is leading us steadily to Communism.
