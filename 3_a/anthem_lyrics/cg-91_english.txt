1. Stand up, courageous homeland
You who in three glorious days
Seized the flag and opened the door
For a free and new Congo,
That never again will fail,
Frighten anyone.

CHORUS:
Weâ€™ve broken our chains,
We will work without penalty,
We are a sovereign nation.

2. If the enemy kills me too early,
Brave comrade, seize my gun;
And if the ball touches my heart,
All our sisters will stand without fear,
And our mountains, our streams into a rage
Repel the invader.

Chorus

3. Here begins the Fatherland
Where every human has the same price.
Our only guide is the People.
Our genius is still the People.
It is he alone who decided
To restore its dignity.

Chorus
