1. Faith and firmness gave birth
In the splendour of a new chant
The Azores are our assurance
Of tracing the glory of a people

BRIDGE:
Ahead! In communion,
For our Autonomy.
Liberty, justice and reason
Are lit up in the lightning
Of the Flag that guides us

CHORUS:
Ahead! Fight, Battle
For the immortal past
Seed in future the light
Of a triumphant people

2. Of a destiny achieved with pride
To pick more fruit and flowers
Because this is the sacred way
Of the stars that crown the Azores.

BRIDGE:
Ahead, Azoreans!
For peace in the united land.
We take large flights,
So that branches of deserved victory
Flower better.

Chorus
