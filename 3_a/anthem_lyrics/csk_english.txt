Where is my home, where is my home?
Water roaring across meadows,
Pines whisper across crags,
In the garden shine the blossoms,
Paradise on earth it is to see!
And thatâ€™s the beautiful land,
Czech land, my home.
Czech land, my home.

Lighting flashes over the Tatra, the thunder pounds wildly,
Lighting flashes over the Tatra, the thunder pounds wildly.
Let us pause, brothers,
they will surely disappear,
the Slovaks will revive.
Let us pause, brothers,
they will surely disappear,
the Slovaks will revive.
