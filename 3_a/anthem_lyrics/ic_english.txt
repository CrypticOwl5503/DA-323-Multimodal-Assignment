I am the shade of an almond tree,
I am volcano, saltpeter and lava.
Distributed in seven islands
the pulse of my soul beats.
I am history and future,
a heart that illuminates the dawn
over our islands that are set
for sailing towards hope.
Fighters in nobility
defend the bright pillar
of freedom.
This is our beloved soil:
my Canary Islands.
As a single one
to be together
dreams the dream of peace
on the wide sea.
