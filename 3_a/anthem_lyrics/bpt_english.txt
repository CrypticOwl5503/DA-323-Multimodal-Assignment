1. This land of our Forefathers
It is given to us by God
Without shedding of blood
Let us give thanks, and rejoice
Let us give thanks, and rejoice

2. This land of our Forefathers
We pledge our lives to it
We shall labour for it
Till the sweat turns to blood
Till the sweat turns to blood

3. This land of cattle and corn
Our lasting heritage
May God safeguard it fittingly
That we may live in it safely
That we may live in it safely

4. God bless our land
That peace and harmony may reign
God bless our Government and nation
That in good health we may produce lifegiving fruits.
That in good health we may produce lifegiving fruits.
