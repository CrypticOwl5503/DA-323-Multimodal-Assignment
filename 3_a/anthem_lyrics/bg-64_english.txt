1. Bulgaria, dear, you’re the land of our heroes!
Incessant and mighty has surged your ascent.
The link with our brothers shall grow ever stronger;
The firm, soldier’s link with the Soviet land!

CHORUS:
Hail, our Republic, we sing to your glory!
May you fore’er be a true shield of peace! –
But should an enemy storm o’er the country,
Lead us to battle, to glorious feats!

2. How great is the sun of our Lenin and Stalin,
Whose unequalled splendour throws light on our way!
The hearts which Dimitrov has fired are flaming
In struggle and work with so dazzling a ray!

Chorus

3. We’re digging our mines, we are working and building,
We’re tilling in common the large tract of soil.
Our country, our beautiful country thus serving
With all that we have, with our lives and our toil.

Chorus
