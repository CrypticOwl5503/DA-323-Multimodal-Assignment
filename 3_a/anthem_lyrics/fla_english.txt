1. They won’t tame him, the proud Flemish Lion
Even if they threat his freedom, with fettering and shouting
They won’t tame him, as long as one Fleming is still alive
As long as the Lion can claw, as long as he has teeth

CHORUS:
They won’t tame him, as long as one Fleming is still alive
As long as the Lion can claw, as long as he has teeth

2. Time will devour the cities, no thrones will ever last
Armies may go under, but a people never die.
The enemy will attack, surrounded by the fear of death
we laugh with his anger: the Flemish Lion is there!

Chorus
