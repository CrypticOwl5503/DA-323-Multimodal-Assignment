Do you know the city on the amber beach,
wreathed by everlasting green forests,
where slender gables stretch upwards
towards the sunshine !


Yes, should I live merrily
it must be in Danzig !

Do you know the city, where tower at tower
loyally resists the storms of time
where proud ships slide
towards the blue sea !


Yes, should I bravely struggle
it must be for Danzig !

Do you know the city, where German kind
defends its wealth with might and main,
where in German the bells invite
and where Germanâ€™s every stone !


Yes, should I blessedly die,
It must be in Danzig !
