We were born at night when the she-wolf whelped,
In the morning, to lion’s deafening roar, were named.
There is no God but Allah.

In eagles’ nests our mothers nursed us,
To tame wild bulls our fathers taught us.
There is no God but Allah.

Our mothers raised us to dedicate ourselves to our sacred land,
And if they need us we’re ready to fight the oppressive hand.
There is no God but Allah.

We were born and grew up free as the mountain eagles,
With dignity and honour we always overcome hardship and obstacles.
There is no God but Allah.

Granite rocks will sooner fuse like lead,
Than we will lose our honour in life’s struggles.
There is no God but Allah.

Earth will sooner be swallowed up by the broiling sun,
Than we emerge from a trial in life without our honour!
There is no God but Allah.

Never will we submit and become slaves,
Death or freedom, for us there’s only one way.
There is no God but Allah.

Our sisters’ songs will cure our wounds,
Our beloved’s eyes will supply the strength of arms.
There is no God but Allah.

If hunger weaken us, we’ll gnaw on roots,
And if thirst debilitates us, we’ll drink dew.
There is no God but Allah.

For we were born at night when the she-wolf whelped.
God, Nation and Vainakh homeland.
There is no God but Allah.
