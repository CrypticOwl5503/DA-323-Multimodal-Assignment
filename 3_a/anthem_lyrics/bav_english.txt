1. God with you, oh land of Bavarians,
German soil, fatherland!
Above your wide areas
your blessed hand shall rest!
Shall He protect your fields,
shield your cities’ walls
and conserve to you the colours
of His skies, white and blue!

2. God with you, the people of Bavaria,
that we, worthy like our fathers,
live in unity and peace
creating the source of our happiness!
That, with Germany’s brother-tribes
in consens we are seen by everyone
and proof the legendary glory
of our flag white and blue!
