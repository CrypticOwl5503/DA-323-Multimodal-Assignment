1. Almighty God of Justice,
We implore you to protect our Tsar.
Endow him with strength
To crush all foes.

For the foesâ€™ defeat
And a bright future
Grant, o Lord, the Tsar of Tsars,
Sunlit days to our Tsar.

2. And to the Bulgarian tribe,
Enlighten, God, the mind,
To fill with love,
And blossom together.

With agreement so it could,
Strength, will, it to develop,
With development, allow it God,
A glorious name to get!
