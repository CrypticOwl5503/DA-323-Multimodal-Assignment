1. French people, brave people,
Freedom opens your arms;
We were told: “Be slaves!”
Suddenly, in the memory of Paris,
His cry of glory is found:

CHORUS:
Forward! walk
Against the cannons!
Through the iron, the fire of the battalions,
Run to victory!

2. Close your ranks to support it!
Walk! each child of Paris
Citizen of the cartridge
Make a gift to his country.
O day of eternal memory
Paris has more than a cry of glory

Chorus

3. The shrapnel in vain we devour:
The birth of fighters!
Under the shot, see hatched
The old generals of twenty years!
O day of eternal memory
Paris has more than a cry of glory:

Chorus

4. To break their dense masses
Who leads our flags bloody?
It is the Freedom of both worlds
It is La Fayette with white hair.
O day of eternal memory
Paris has more than a cry of glory:

Chorus

5. The three colors are back
And the column with pride
Shines through the clouds,
The rainbow of Liberty.
O day of eternal memory
Paris has more than a cry of glory:

Chorus

6. Soldiers of the Tricolore
D’Orleans, thou who hast
Your blood mingle again
To him it cost us;
As the heyday of our history
You restate your cry of glory:

Chorus

7. Drums, the convoy of our fathers
Roll the funeral signal!
And we, the popular laurels,
Instruct their coffin triumphant!
O Temple of grief and glory,
Pantheon, get their memory!

CHORUS:
Wear them, walk!
Discover our brows
Be immortals, all of you that we mourn,
Martyrs of Victory!
