1. Endure, heroic people of Kalev‘s
And stand as a rock, our homeland!
Your courage did not subside in the sufferings,
You broke yourself through the centuries,
And arose a socialist country in blossom,
For sun could shine in your days.

2. Ye roar, factories, and corn-fields, wave;
Reap, sickle, and beat out, hammer!
May life of the Soviets throb in mighty swing;
May happiness be brought to people by good labor!
Among our Soviet nations and states
Estonia, march in the firm fore!

3. You’re bearing Lenin’s banner high,
You’re boldly marching your Communist way.
Our Party will lead our steps
And take us from victory to victory.
Grow in her firm leadership
And become mighty and fair, our Homeland!
