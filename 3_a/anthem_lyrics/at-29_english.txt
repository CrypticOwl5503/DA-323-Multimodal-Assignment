1. German Austria, you wonderful land, we do love you!
High over alp, beneath glacier dome
Waters stream freely to Danube-flow:
They give drink to lambs and shepherds in highland,
At the falls they drive mills and hammers,
Greet many villages, many towns and stretch
Rejoicing to the aim, our unique Vienna!
You wonderful land, our native land,
We do love you, we stand for you.

2. German Austria, your people of skills, we do love you!
Your ground is hard and your bread is scarce,
However need makes you clever and strong.
Soles, that like mountains are stable,
Feelings, that like water are live,
Hearts so radiant, full of benevolence
Create themselves their happiness, their art.
Your people of skills, our native people,
We do love you, we stand for you.

3. German Austria, your people of sense, we do love you!
Need and remorse has stood you in good stead …
Be now in freedom true to yourself!
Is a battlefield anywhere in the realm,
Where bones of your sons haven’t appeared white?
Eventually you’ve broken down the chains.
Be on your own, be yours! Be free!
Your people of sense, our sufferer people,
We do love you, we stand for you.

4. German Austria, league of mountains lands, we do love you!
Free through the deed and united through choice,
One through the fate and especially through blood.
Welded for ever, land of East Alps!
Faithful to Union and to our people!
Peace to the friend, and to the threatening foe,
Defensive persistence in battle and need!
Your mountainous land, our East Alps land,
We do love you, we stand for you.
