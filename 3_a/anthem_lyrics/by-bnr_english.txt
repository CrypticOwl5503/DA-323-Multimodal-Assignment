1. We will walk in the solid columns
In our free and wide spaces.
Let freedom always be with us,
And we shall resist violence.

2. Let our free Belarusian spirit
Live always powerful and brave.
Let our white-red-white flag
Symbolize our people’s movement.

3. Hasten to fight for the happiness and freedom
Of our glorious nation!
Brothers! We’ve suffered enough.
Hasten to fight, all as one.

4. Let the name and strength of the Belarusian
Be heard and seen by anyone,
Who is bold enough to dictate to us,
Who is first to challenge us to the fight.

5. Brothers, we are approaching the happiness.
Let the thunder sound more loudly
In the bloody agony we bear
We will restore our Republic’s life.
