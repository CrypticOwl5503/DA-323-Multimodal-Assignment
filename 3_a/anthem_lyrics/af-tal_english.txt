CHORUS:
We defend it with our blood, this is the home of the martyrs!
This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave!

All your stones and bushes look like rubies to us!
Blood is spilled upon them, they are all red like roses!
Do you think it can be conquered? It is the home of the lions!
This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave!

Chorus

We will protect your freedom, as long as our lives last!
We will remember your history, as long as our lives last!
Eagles will inhabit you, this is the home of the eagles!
This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave!

Chorus

Oh, the dear land of mine, I have offered my life for your sake!
Oh, the beautiful lawn of mine, I have offered my life for your sake!
Once we were liberated from the British, we became a grave for the Russians!
This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave!

Chorus

Look at these hills and peaks, the Russians have left them!
Every enemy has failed, all their hopes got shattered!
Now it is obvious to everyone, this is the home of the Afghans!
This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave!

Chorus
