1. Your cornfields and your mountains are enchanting, Motherland,
Your sun and your sea are curative, Motherland.
We’ll save this land
And pass to our grandsons like a garden flourishing Crimea,
Like a garden flourishing Crimea!

2. The dawns of freedom have warmed you, Motherland,
The people-brothers have praised you, Motherland.
We’ll save this land
And will together, the Crimeans, glorify Crimea in the centuries,
Glorify Crimea in the centuries!

Be glorious, Crimea!
