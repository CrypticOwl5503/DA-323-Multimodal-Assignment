1. The collar of slavery hard
And darkness of grey fate
We crashed with fire and word
In cruel unequal fight.

CHORUS:
Our peopleâ€™s republic,
Our republic- Hail!
Today our land is free,
Today everyone lives free!

2. For us the freedom is sacred
And we will defend it with love.
The blood of the fighters is spilled,
On every Hallow and ditch.

Chorus

3. For our and foreign tyrants,
Motherland, there is no space!
We remember the numerous wounds
The fascist bloody terror!

Chorus
