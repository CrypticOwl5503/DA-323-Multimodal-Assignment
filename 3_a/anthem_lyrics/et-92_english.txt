Ethiopia, Ethiopia – Ethiopia, be first
In socialism – flourish, be fertile!

Your brave sons have made a covenant,
That your rivers and mountains, your virgin land
Should be a sacrifice for the unity of Ethiopia, for your freedom,
To your honour and renown!

Strive forwards on the road of wisdom,
Gird yourself for the task,
For the prosperity of the land!

You are the mother of heroes – be proud of your sons,
May your enemies perish – may you live for ever!
