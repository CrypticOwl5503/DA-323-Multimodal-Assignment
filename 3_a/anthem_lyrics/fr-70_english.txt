1. Going to Syria
The young and beautiful Dunois
When he went to ask the Virgin Mary,
His heroic deeds to bless,
Do you, immortal Queen
He said on his leaving,
I love the most beautiful
And am the bravest
I love the most beautiful
And am the bravest

2. He wrote on stone
The oath of honor
And followed into war
The earl, his lord.
The noble desire faithfulness
He said to his fighter:
Love the most beautiful
Honor to the brave
Love the most beautiful
Honor to the brave

3. We owe you the victory
Verily! says the lord,
Since you have established my glory,
I will make you happy!
My daughter Isabella
Will be your wife
For she is the most beautiful
And you the bravest
For she is the most beautiful
And you the bravest

4. At the altar of Mary,
They pledged both
This dear union
Which makes the lonely happy.
Everyone in the chapel
Said seeing them:
Love the most beautiful
Honor to the brave
Love the most beautiful
Honor to the brave.
