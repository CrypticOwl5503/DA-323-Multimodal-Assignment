1. Maritsa rushes,
stained with blood,
A widow wails,
fiercely wounded.

CHORUS:
March, march,
with our General,
Let’s fly into battle
and crush the enemy!

2. Bulgarians,
the whole world beholds you.
Into a winning battle,
let’s gloriously go.

Chorus

3. The Balkan lion
leads us flying
Into a gigantic battle
with the enemy hordes.

Chorus

4. Young and strong,
in the rattle of battle
We’re destined to gain
laurels to claim.

Chorus

5. We’re the nation,
our pride, liberation,
And dear fatherland
till death shall defend.

Chorus
