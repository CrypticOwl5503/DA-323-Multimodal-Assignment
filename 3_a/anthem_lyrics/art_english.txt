We are building free and independent
Artsakh like a fortress,
The history of my state is written by
Sacred blood of heroes.

You are sacred shrine for ages
Stands as an invincible stronghold
God protected Artsakh
You make eternity real.

Our Fatherland is our light
A temple of love in supplications and hearts
Following precepts of forefathers
Let peace always be in Karabagh!

We are brave descendants of Haik
Like Mrav, Kirs and everlasting Terter
With our temples in high mountains
Keep our country invincible.
