1. Land of the sun and soft breeze
Proud land resurrected from the sea
Modest people, always satisfied
Always bravely defending themselves
Let us try every day
To announce Bonaire
And we sing in good harmony:
Delightful Bonaire, our beloved fatherland

2. Let us together as Bonaireans
All sing and raise our voices
we, being children of a healthy race
Always happy, beleiving in God
No power can take us this love away
As we feel it for our island
Although itâ€™s small and not perfect
We love it more than anything
