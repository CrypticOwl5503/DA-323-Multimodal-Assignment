Peace returns
All French Princes
Sing the anthem,
Today and henceforth
What takes this happiness
Long live the King! Long live peace!

Long live France
And the wise Bourbons
Merciful,
Whose hearts are all good!
Peace, abundance
Come in our townships.

What extreme joy
Live, vivacious Artois!
Duke of Angouleme!
Sing all for
Louis the eighteenth
Descendant of kings!

The diadem
Of France is a king
Our hope even
Is the reason why
Yes, Louis loves us,
Long live the King!

No more sadness,
Long live Louis!
Princes, princesses,
We are delighted,
That joys
Prevail in all countries!
