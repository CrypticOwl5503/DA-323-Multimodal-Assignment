1. What do the murmurers say
on the greenish coast
to the transparent beam
of the placid moonlight?
What do the high
dark pine needle jagged tops say
with its well compased
monotonous buzzing?

2. “With your girdled greenness
and with benign stars
to the borders of the green hill forts
and the valuable plains,
don’t give to oblivion
or outrage your hard effort;
wake up from your dream
home of Breogán.

3. “The good and generous
our voice understand,
and with determination they attend
our harsh sounds,
but only the ignorant,
and wounded and hard,
fools and those who dwell in the dark
don’t understand us, they do not.

4. “The times are arrived
sung of by ancient Bards,
that your aimless wanderings
will be at an end;
because everywhere, gigantic
our voice proclaims
the redention of the good
Nation of Breogán”.
