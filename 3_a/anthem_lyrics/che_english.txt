No matter you may burn with fire of injustice,
Chechnya, you didn’t fall, stood up to live.
Lightning of Caucasia, cradle of liberty,
Proud people guarded the honor of your land.

Concord among your peoples is a priceless wealth!
There is no mother, but you, to caress the people of Chechnya.
Extolling you, we beg to bless
Our life and our death in Motherland’s hearth!

Our ancestors’ souls come down to the top of Bashlam.
Wave of the Argun speaks the native tongue.
The perfect gift, you have given us life!
The Shatlak’s song gave us strength!

Let love of work and valor, respect of people
Be pleasant news for you!
Being on guard of liberty, having found a happy way,
Live for us, worthy Chechnya!
