CHORUS:
O! for ages! my weapon!
How I long to clutch thee!
Respond, awake and on alert,
For our valiant combat.

1. Hail, gallant troops of the people,
Dashing with thunderous roar,
Swearing never to return,
Except with epoch-making victory.

2. Rise and raise a host for all,
With loyal hearts ready for the death.
O! the horror the foe shall fear,
Through the fire of our zeal.

3. O! glory of our Country,
Achieved with our own efforts alone,
By the hard hours of timeless toil,
Never to be wasted or endangered.

4. Who shall protect Free Egypt?
We shall protect it with our lives.
Land of the Revolution, who will die for her sake?
We will, with our lives.

5. The people advance like the light,
The people stand like mountains and seas,
like Angry erupting volcanoes,
Earthquakes digging graves for the enemy.
