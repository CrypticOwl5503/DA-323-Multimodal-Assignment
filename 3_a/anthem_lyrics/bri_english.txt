1. We Bretons of courage, we love our true Country
Armorica is famous throughout the world
Without fear, and a warrior’s heart, our great ancestors
Shed their blood for her

CHORUS:
Oh Brittany, my Country! I love my Country.
As long as the sea will be a wall around her.
Be free my Country!

2. Brittany, land of saints and old land of Bards
There is no other country in the world that I love so much
Every mountain, every valley is dear to my heart
In them sleep many a bold Breton.

Chorus

3. The Breton people are hard and strong
No nation under heaven is so courageous.
Sad ballads, charming songs spring up in her
O! How beautiful you are, my Country!

Chorus

4. If you have once fallen in wars, Brittany
Your language has remained alive for ever
His fervent heart trembles even for her.
You’re awake now my Brittany!

Chorus
