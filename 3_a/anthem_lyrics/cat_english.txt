1. Triumphant, Catalonia,
Will once again be rich and full!
We must not be the prey
Of those proud and arrogant invaders!

CHORUS:
Let us swing the sickle!
Let us swing the sickle, defenders of our land!
Let us swing the sickle!

2. Now it is moment, oh reapers!
Now it is moment, to be alert!
Awaiting the arrival of another June
Let us sharpen our tools!

Chorus

3. May our enemy tremble
On seeing our noble flag:
Just as we reap the golden corn,
May we also cut free of the chains!

Chorus
