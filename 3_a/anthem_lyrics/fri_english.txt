1. Friesian bloods come up wants to seethe and boil
And through our veins flow!
Fly up, we sing of the best land on the earth:
Our Friesian land full of honour and glory!

CHORUS:
Sound loud than and thunder far in a round:
Your old honour, o Friesian ground!
Sound loud than and thunder far in a round:
Your old honour, o Friesian ground!

2. How also from other nations, need, and sea threatened,
age-old, beloved Frisian ground,
Those stead fast bonds were never broken,
that bound the Frisians to their land.

Chorus

3. Unused to bowing, they stayed by the old folk in honor,
their name and language, their sense of freedom.
Their word was law, right, humble and true they teach,
and opposed to coercion from whomever it might come.

Chorus

4. Serene folk of this old name,
Be always proud on your forefathers!
Stay forever of the grey, high stem
A green and mighty flowering offspring!

Chorus
