The bright red blood was spilled over the towns
And over the plain of Kampuchea, our motherland,
The blood of our good workers and farmers and of
Our revolutionary combatants, both men and women.

Their blood produced a great anger and the courage
To contend with heroism. On the 17th of April,
Under the revolutionary banner, their blood freed
Us from the state of slavery.

Hurrah for the 17th of April!
That wonderful victory had greater significance
Than the Angkor period!

We are uniting to construct a Kampuchea with a
New and better society, democratic, egalitarian
And just. We follow the road to a firmly-based
Independence. We absolutely guarantee to defend
Our motherland, our fine territory, our
Magnificent revolution!

Hurrah for the new Kampuchea, a splendid,
Democratic land of plenty! We guarantee to raise
Aloft and wave the red banner of the revolution.
We shall make our motherland prosperous beyond
All others, magnificent, wonderful!
