1. The voices of cannon alarm
France calls her children
– Come said the soldier, to arms!
It’s my mother, I defend.

CHORUS:
Dying for the Fatherland
Dying for the Fatherland
It is the fate most beautiful, most envied
It is the fate most beautiful, most envied

2. We, friends, who battle away
Succumb in obscurity
Vow at least our funeral
In France, in freedom.

Chorus

3. Brothers, for a holy cause,
When each of us is a martyr,
Do not utter a complaint,
France, one day we shall bless.

Chorus

4. O Creator of nature,
Bless our bounty again,
We would complain about an injury,
We are dying for freedom.

Chorus
