CHORUS:
Become hot, become more hot,
You, the holy sun.
O sun of freedom,
O sun of good fortune.

1. We through the storm
Have come to the end of the road.
We have also traversed the paths of darkness,
Also the way of light.
The red road of victory,
The pure path of brotherhood.

Chorus

2. Our revolutionary homeland
Is now in the hands of the workers.
The inheritance of lions
Now belongs to the peasants.
The age of tyranny has passed,
The turn of the labourers has come.

Chorus

3. We want peace and brotherhood
Between the peoples of the world.
We demand more freedom
For all who toil.
We want bread for them,
We want houses and clothes.
