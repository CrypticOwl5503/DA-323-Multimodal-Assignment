1. Blessed be endlessly,
Wonderful native land!
Green firs and golden spikes
Friendly adorn your lands.
German labor – earnest and conscientious,
German love – tender and soft –
Fatherland, how marvelous you are,
God with thee, my Austria!

2. No tyranny, no serfs,
Open way for every force!
Equal duties, equal rights,
Free art and science!
Strong bravery, firm look,
Despite every stroke of fate
Go up along the path of happiness,
God with thee, my Austria!

3. Let’s, through no discord divided,
Look at one goal,
Let’s in concord and in peace
Build on the boon of future!
Strong youth of our people
Becomes like its forefathers,
Blessed be, native land,
God with thee, my Austria!
